#Hardware Schematics for Telemonitoring nodes

![alt text][master_diag]

## How to Read/Open

The files are made with eagle cad. 

There are image files naming  *.PNG  

Currently Schematics is drawn in a way which can easily be implimented with one sided perforated board. (to avoid PCB printing cost for early developers.) 

**Please Note:** the top layer on PCB (the red streaks) need not to be solder bridged, rather a thin wire may be used which shall be soldered on bottom side.
