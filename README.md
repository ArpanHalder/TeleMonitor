# TeleMonitor
This Open Hardware initiative is focused mostly for industrial application. In fact this started with designing a low cost Telemonitoring system for Mining Industry Applications.

#Motivation
While demonstrating the device in laboratory, several preparatory commercial and personal tools were being used. However, not every educational institute has access to premium facilities. This project is initiated to enable us (who have access to premium education) to build some full scale copyleft open technology that can be used in academia as well as in industries.
(Soon projects for IDE of this device, and Open Source Analytics & Visualization tools for this project shall be published after implementation of first working prototype.)

##Design Approaches
One of the primary objective is keeping the hardware cheap, simple and reparable. We don't want a design where if one component fails whole circuit is replaced, which create extra junk on surface of earth.

###This Device is motivated with the idea of "Democratization of Technology & Education"

This is why we wish to keep the design simple simple and affordable like DIY projects, however rich with all necessary features. This we can hopefully achieve by cognitive support of the community. We also suggest to restrict use of components in the design that tier III nations cannot afford to import or implement in the industries. 

##Ways to Contribute in this project
While demonstrating the device in laboratory, several propitiatory commercial and personal tools were being used. However, not every educational institute has access to premium facilities.
