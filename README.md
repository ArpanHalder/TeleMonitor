# TeleMonitor
This Open Hardware initiative is focused mostly on industrial application. In fact, this started with designing a low-cost Telemonitoring system for Mining Industry Applications. It is an embedded data transmission setup made up on small Arduino like boards. For long distance communication between device nodes, it uses RS-485

##Motivation
While working in the laboratory, our team did experiment similar thing using state of the art services. However, not every educational institute has access to premium facilities. This project is initiated to enable us (who have access to premium education) to build some full-scale copyleft open technology that can be used for demonstration of remote monitoring operation in academia as well as in industries.
(After the device, hopefully soon the projects for IDE of this instrument, and Open Source Analytics & Visualization tools for this project shall be published after development of first working prototype.)

##Design Approaches
One of the primary objectives is keeping the hardware cheap, straightforward and reparable. We don't want a design where if one component fails the whole circuit is replaced, which create extra junk on the surface of the earth.

###This Device is motivated by the idea of "Democratisation of Technology & Education."

This is why we wish to keep the design simple and affordable like DIY projects, however, rich with all necessary features. This we can hopefully achieve by the cognitive support of the community. We also suggest restricting use of components in the design that tier III nations cannot afford to import or implement in the industries. 

##Ways to Contribute in this project

Discuss the possible improvement, and feature requirements.
