# TeleMonitor
This Open Hardware initiative is focused mostly for industrial application. In fact this started with designing a low cost Telemonitoring system for Mining Industry Applications.

##Design Approaches
One of the primary objective is keeping the hardware cheap, simple and reparable. We don't want a design where if one component fails whole circuit is replaced, which create extra junk on surface of earth.

###This Device is motivated with the idea of "Democratization of Technology & Education"

This is why we wish to keep the design simple simple and affortable like DIY projects, but feature rich with help of community suggestions. We also suggest to restrict use of components in the design that tiar III nations cannot afford to import and impliment in their industries. 

##Ways to Contribute in this project
While demonstrating the device in labratory, several proparatory commercial and personal tools were being used.
